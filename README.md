## Requirements
The exact command that should be replicated is:

                                                        < infile command1 | command2 > outfile

and the input must be entered in the following way:

                                                ./pipex infile "command1 + args" "command2 + args" outfile
                                                
For the command part of the input you can receive either a standard command i.e. "ls" or the relative/absolute route i.e. (./.. , /usr/bin/ls, ../...),  the error handling as well has to be very bash-like so I made it quite similar.
Also, your program has to be able to execute and handle the lack of environment variables (compilation with env -i).

Aditionally, I implemented single quote support (') so awk commands could be functionals, not the case with $x since itÂ´s on bash to handle them properly.

On the makefile some tests are implemented, only for success cases, error cases have to be manually checked. You can check this tests by using:

                                                                  make tests
